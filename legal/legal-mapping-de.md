# **Legal Mapping — Germany (DE)**

## Living Vote Protocol (LVP) and the German Constitutional Framework

**Document type:** Legal mapping / discourse paper
**Status:** Public, non-normative
**Related release:** v0.1-core-proof

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document maps the **Living Vote Protocol (LVP)** to the **German constitutional and legal framework**.

It addresses the question:

> *Is the Living Vote Protocol structurally incompatible with German constitutional law?*

This paper does **not** claim legality, adoption, or superiority.
It establishes **constitutional non-contradiction at the conceptual level**.

---

## 2. Constitutional Baseline (Grundgesetz)

Relevant constitutional norms:

* **Art. 20 (1)–(2) GG** — Democracy, popular sovereignty
* **Art. 38 (1) GG** — Election principles
* **Art. 21 GG** — Political parties
* **Art. 28 (1) GG** — Democratic principles at state and municipal level
* **Art. 79 (3) GG** — Eternity clause (Ewigkeitsgarantie)

The Living Vote Protocol must be assessed **against these principles**, not against political custom.

---

## 3. Art. 20 GG — Popular Sovereignty

### 3.1 Constitutional Principle

Art. 20 (2) GG:

> “All state authority emanates from the people.”

The constitution does **not** prescribe:

* a single mechanism of legitimacy
* a fixed temporal structure
* exclusivity of elections as the only legitimacy signal

Elections are a **historically established implementation**, not the sole constitutional possibility.

---

### 3.2 LVP Position

The Living Vote Protocol:

* leaves sovereignty entirely with citizens
* does not transfer authority to technical systems
* prevents permanent alienation of political influence

**Conclusion:**
LVP is **compatible in principle** with Art. 20 GG, as it intensifies, not restricts, popular sovereignty.

---

## 4. Art. 38 GG — Election Principles

Art. 38 GG governs **elections to the Bundestag**.
It does **not** prohibit additional, non-binding legitimacy mechanisms.

### 4.1 Generality and Equality

* LVP assigns exactly **one political profile per citizen**
* No inherent weighting or hierarchy exists
* Delegation alters *use*, not *value*, of a vote

**Assessment:**
No violation of equality or generality.

---

### 4.2 Freedom

* Participation is voluntary
* Profiles can remain NEUTRAL or DORMANT
* No sanctions for non-participation

**Assessment:**
Participation freedom is preserved.

---

### 4.3 Directness

Directness in Art. 38 GG refers to the absence of hidden intermediaries.

LVP:

* applies profile state directly to aggregation
* does not introduce opaque decision chains
* makes delegation explicit and reversible

**Assessment:**
No reduction of directness; arguably increased transparency.

---

### 4.4 Secrecy

LVP separates:

* identity ownership (private)
* aggregated legitimacy signals (public)

No public vote disclosure is required.

**Assessment:**
Conceptually compatible with secrecy requirements.

---

### 4.5 Interim Conclusion on Art. 38 GG

The Living Vote Protocol:

* does not replace elections
* does not modify Bundestag election law
* does not interfere with electoral mandates

**Art. 38 GG is not violated.**

---

## 5. Representative Democracy and Parliament

### 5.1 No Mandate Interference

LVP:

* does not grant mandates
* does not withdraw mandates
* does not bind parliamentary decisions

Parliamentary authority remains **untouched**.

---

### 5.2 Additional Information, Not Authority

LVP produces:

* legitimacy signals
* preference distributions
* trend indicators

These are **political information**, not legal commands.

**Assessment:**
No encroachment on parliamentary sovereignty.

---

## 6. Art. 21 GG — Political Parties

Art. 21 GG protects:

* freedom of party formation
* internal democratic order

It does **not** guarantee:

* monopoly over legitimacy
* exclusive access to political influence

LVP:

* neither prohibits nor privileges parties
* allows citizens to delegate to parties or individuals
* removes no constitutional protection

**Assessment:**
Art. 21 GG remains unaffected.

---

## 7. Art. 79 (3) GG — Eternity Clause

The eternity clause protects:

* democracy
* rule of law
* human dignity

LVP:

* preserves democracy
* does not abolish elections
* does not replace constitutional organs

It alters **procedure**, not **principle**.

**Assessment:**
No conflict with Art. 79 (3) GG.

---

## 8. Legal Risk Boundary (Explicit)

This mapping applies **only** as long as:

* LVP remains non-binding
* no administrative acts are executed
* no legal obligations are created
* no electoral mandates are replaced

Any binding or coercive implementation would require **separate legal analysis**.

---

## 9. Interim Legal Conclusion

From a German constitutional perspective:

> **The Living Vote Protocol is not structurally incompatible with the Grundgesetz
> as a non-binding, procedural legitimacy model.**

It raises **political and legal questions**, but no inherent constitutional contradiction.

---

## 10. Status

This document provides a **discourse-ready legal mapping** for Germany (DE).

It does not:

* request adoption
* assert legality
* replace legislative processes

It establishes **non-contradiction**, not approval.

---

## Closing Statement

> **The Living Vote Protocol challenges political habit,
> not constitutional foundations.**

Whether and how it is used remains a matter of democratic choice — not of technical feasibility.

---

### Document validity

Valid for the protocol core as defined in **v0.1-core-proof**.
Any change to the core requires renewed legal mapping.
