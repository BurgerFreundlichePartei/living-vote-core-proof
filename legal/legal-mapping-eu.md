# **Legal Mapping — European Union (EU)**

## Living Vote Protocol (LVP) and the EU Legal Framework

**Document type:** Legal mapping / discourse paper
**Status:** Public, non-normative
**Related release:** v0.1-core-proof

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document maps the **Living Vote Protocol (LVP)** to the **legal and constitutional framework of the European Union
**.

It addresses the question:

> *Is the Living Vote Protocol structurally incompatible with EU law and democratic principles?*

This paper does **not** claim legal adoption, binding force, or institutional authority.
It establishes **legal non-contradiction at the conceptual level**.

---

## 2. EU Legal Baseline

Relevant sources:

* **Article 2 TEU** — Union values (democracy, rule of law)
* **Article 10 TEU** — Representative democracy
* **Article 11 TEU** — Participatory democracy
* **Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (CFR)** — political freedoms
* **Principle of conferral and subsidiarity** (Articles 4–5 TEU)

The EU does **not** prescribe a single democratic mechanism beyond minimum principles.

---

## 3. Article 2 TEU — Democratic Values

### 3.1 Core Requirement

Article 2 TEU establishes democracy as a **foundational value**, not a fixed procedural form.

It does not mandate:

* exclusive reliance on elections
* uniform participatory mechanisms across Member States
* prohibition of non-binding legitimacy models

---

### 3.2 LVP Position

The Living Vote Protocol:

* preserves citizen agency
* does not centralize authority
* does not replace representative institutions

**Assessment:**
LVP is **compatible in principle** with the democratic value framework of Article 2 TEU.

---

## 4. Article 10 TEU — Representative Democracy

Article 10 TEU states that:

> “The functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy.”

This provision defines **institutional structure**, not exclusivity of legitimacy signals.

### 4.1 No Institutional Replacement

LVP:

* does not elect representatives
* does not assign mandates
* does not interfere with parliamentary authority

Representative democracy remains **unchanged**.

---

### 4.2 Additional Legitimacy Information

LVP produces:

* continuous legitimacy indicators
* preference distributions
* delegation structures

These outputs are **informational**, not normative.

**Assessment:**
Article 10 TEU is not infringed, as representation is not altered.

---

## 5. Article 11 TEU — Participatory Democracy

Article 11 TEU explicitly encourages:

* citizen participation
* dialogue
* consultation mechanisms

### 5.1 Alignment with Participatory Principles

LVP:

* enables continuous participation
* allows voluntary engagement
* avoids coercion or obligation
* preserves the right to abstain

**Assessment:**
LVP aligns structurally with Article 11 TEU’s participatory objectives.

---

### 5.2 Distinction from the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI)

LVP is **not**:

* an initiative mechanism
* a legislative trigger
* a petition system

It does not compete with or replace the ECI.

---

## 6. Fundamental Rights (EU Charter)

### 6.1 Equality (Articles 20–21 CFR)

* One profile per citizen
* No inherent weighting
* No discrimination by design

**Assessment:**
Conceptually compatible with equality principles.

---

### 6.2 Freedom of Expression and Participation (Articles 11–12 CFR)

* Participation is voluntary
* Profiles can remain inactive
* No sanctions for non-participation

**Assessment:**
No restriction of political freedoms.

---

### 6.3 Data Protection and Privacy (Articles 7–8 CFR)

LVP separates:

* identity ownership (private)
* aggregated legitimacy signals (public)

The protocol core:

* does not require personal data disclosure
* does not mandate data persistence
* does not prescribe technical identity systems

**Assessment:**
No inherent conflict with EU privacy principles at the protocol level.

---

## 7. Competence and Subsidiarity

### 7.1 Principle of Conferral

The EU acts only within conferred competences.

LVP:

* claims no EU competence
* imposes no obligations on Member States
* does not require EU-level implementation

---

### 7.2 Subsidiarity and Optionality

LVP can exist:

* at local
* regional
* national
* non-state levels

Its optional and non-binding nature respects subsidiarity.

**Assessment:**
No competence conflict arises.

---

## 8. Non-Decision Principle as Legal Safeguard

A central safeguard is the **non-decision principle**:

> **The Living Vote Protocol derives legitimacy signals but does not enact decisions.**

Consequences:

* no legal acts
* no administrative measures
* no binding obligations

This avoids conflicts with:

* EU legislative procedures
* executive authority
* judicial review mechanisms

---

## 9. Explicit Boundary of Validity

This mapping applies **only** as long as:

* LVP remains non-binding
* no EU institution relies on it as a legal mandate
* no individual rights or obligations are derived directly from it

Any binding use would require **separate EU-level legal analysis**.

---

## 10. Interim Legal Conclusion

From an EU law perspective:

> **The Living Vote Protocol is not structurally incompatible with EU democratic principles
> when used as a non-binding, informational legitimacy model.**

It raises political and constitutional questions,
but no inherent legal contradiction.

---

## 11. Status

This document establishes **EU-level discourse readiness**.

It does not:

* request EU adoption
* assert EU legality
* propose institutional reform

It provides a framework for informed discussion.

---

## Closing Statement

> **The Living Vote Protocol challenges how legitimacy is measured,
> not who holds authority within the European Union.**

---

### Document validity

Valid for the protocol core as defined in **v0.1-core-proof**.
Changes to the core require renewed EU legal mapping.
